Tether
==========

a beautiful way to simplify your life

Tether provides a Force Touch compatible way to set alarms, reminders, and calendar events directly from the home screen.

Simply Force Touch (or triple tap and hold on non-Force Touch devices) to invoke Tether's selection view, and drag your finger to select a time. Let go once you've reached your desired time and choose whether you'd like to create an alarm, reminder, or calender event.
